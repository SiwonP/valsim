Valsim is the name of a brand new language I'm trying to invent.
I would like it to be a compiled language, as well as Object Oriented, a bit like Java actually.
There's a makefile to build the project : 
make build at the root should give you a valsim executable you call from your terminal with the name of your file as argument
